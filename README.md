🌐 DataSphere

DataSphere is a community-driven platform where developers, students, and indie hackers can discover, share, and request datasets for coding, data science, and machine learning projects.

Finding the right dataset is often a bottleneck for students and independent developers. DataSphere aims to solve this problem by offering a collaborative, student-first space focused on accessible, project-ready datasets—without trying to compete with platforms like Kaggle or Hugging Face.
