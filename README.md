DataSphere
DataSphere is a community-driven platform where developers and students can discover, share, and request datasets for coding, data science, and machine learning projects.

Finding relevant datasets is a common struggle for students and indie developers, often leading to abandoned projects. DataSphere aims to solve this by building a collaborative environment where data becomes more approachable and accessible.

It’s not about competing with Kaggle or Hugging Face—it’s about creating a student-first, project-focused hub for datasets.
